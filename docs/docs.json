This feedback was inspired by a vague recollection of an early Mac screen saver (After Dark maybe?) which provided similar functionality. If someone knows for certain, please inform me and I will give appropriate attribution.\n\nNote that sleep prevention is not guaranteed; macOS may override our attempts at staying awake in extreme situations (CPU temperature dangerously high, low battery, etc.) See `hs.caffeinate` for more details.\n\nDownload: https://github.com/Hammerspoon/Spoons/raw/master/Spoons/SleepCorners.spoon.zip",

This feedback was inspired by a vague recollection of an early Mac screen saver (After Dark maybe?) which provided similar functionality. If someone knows for certain, please inform me and I will give appropriate attribution.\n\nNote that sleep prevention is not guaranteed; macOS may override our attempts at staying awake in extreme situations (CPU temperature dangerously high, low battery, etc.) See `hs.caffeinate` for more details.\n\nDownload: https://github.com/Hammerspoon/Spoons/raw/master/Spoons/SleepCorners.spoon.zip",
