    "doc": "This spoon addresses a limitation within the [hs.hotkey](hs.hotkey.html) module that allows the creation of hotkeys bound to specific left or right keyboard modifiers while leaving the other side free.\n\nThis is accomplished by creating unactivated hotkeys for each definition and using an [hs.eventtap](hs.eventtap.html) watcher to detect when modifier keys are pressed and conditionally activating only those hotkeys which correspond to the left or right modifiers currently active as specified by the `bind` and `new` methods of this spoon.\n\nThe `LeftRightHotkeyObject` that is returned by [LeftRightHotkey:new](#new) and [LeftRightHotkey:bind](#bind) supports the following methods in a manner similar to the [hs.hotkey](hs.hotkey.html) equivalents:\n\n * `LeftRightHotkeyObject:enable()`   -- enables the registered hotkey.\n * `LeftRightHotkeyObject:disable()`  -- disables the registered hotkey.\n * `LeftRightHotkeyObject:delete()`   -- deletes the registered hotkey.\n * `LeftRightHotkeyObject:isEnabled() -- returns a boolean value specifying whether the hotkey is currently enabled (true) or disabled (false)\n\nThe following modifiers are recognized by this spoon in the modifier table when setting up hotkeys with this spoon:\n   * \"lCmd\", \"lCommand\", or \"l⌘\" for the left Command modifier\n   * \"rCmd\", \"rCommand\", or \"r⌘\" for the right Command modifier\n   * \"lCtrl\", \"lControl\" or \"l⌃\" for the left Control modifier\n   * \"rCtrl\", \"rControl\" or \"r⌃\" for the right Control modifier\n   * \"lAlt\", \"lOpt\", \"lOption\" or \"l⌥\" for the left Option modifier\n   * \"rAlt\", \"rOpt\", \"rOption\" or \"r⌥\" for the right Option modifier\n   * \"lShift\" or \"l⇧\" for the left Shift modifier\n   * \"rShift\" or \"r⇧\" for the right Shift modifier\n\nThe modifiers table for any given hotkey is all inclusive; this means that if you specify `{ \"rShift\", \"lShift\" }` then *both* the left and right shift keys *must* be pressed to trigger the hotkey -- if you want either/or, then stick with [hs.hotkey](hs.hotkey.html).\n\nAlternatively, if you want to setup a hotkey when *either* command key is pressed with *only* the right shift, you would need to set up two hotkeys with this spoon:\n e.g. `LeftRightHotkey:bind({ \"rCmd\", \"rShift\" }, \"a\", myFunction)` *and* `LeftRightHotkey:bind({ \"lCmd\", \"rShift\" }, \"a\", myFunction)`\n\nThis spoon works by using an eventtap to detect flag changes (modifier keys) and when they change, the appropriate hotkeys are enabled or disabled. This means that you should be aware of the following:\n * like all eventtaps, if the Hammerspoon application is particularly busy with some other task, it is possible for the flag change to be missed or for the macOS to disable the eventtap entirely.\n * behind the scenes, when a given set of flag changes occur that match a defined hotkey, the hotkey is actually enabled through `hs.hotkey:enable()` -- this means that in truth, either side's modifiers would trigger the callback. Under normal circumstances this won't be noticed because as soon as you switch to the alternate side's modifier, the flag change event will be detected and the hotkey will be disabled. However, as noted above, if Hammerspoon is particularly busy, it is possible for this event to be missed.\n   * a timer runs (once this Spoon has been started the first time) which will check to see if the eventtap has been internally disabled and re-enable it if necessary; alternatively you can re-issue [LeftRightHotkey:start()](#start) to force the eventtap to be reset if necessary.\n   * if your hotkeys seem out of sync, try pressing and releasing any modifier key -- this will reset the enabled/disabled hotkeys if a previous flag change was missed, but the eventtap is still running or has been reset by one of the methods described above.\n\nLike all Spoons, don't forget to use the [LeftRightHotkey:start()](#start) method to activate the modifier key watcher.\n\nDownload: [https://github.com/Hammerspoon/Spoons/raw/master/Spoons/LeftRightHotkey.spoon.zip](https://github.com/Hammerspoon/Spoons/raw/master/Spoons/LeftRightHotkey.spoon.zip)",

This means that you should be aware of the following:\n * like all eventtaps, if the Hammerspoon application is particularly busy with some other task, it is possible for the flag change to be missed or for the macOS to disable the eventtap entirely.\n * behind the scenes, when a given set of flag changes occur that match a defined hotkey, the hotkey is actually enabled through `hs.hotkey:enable()` -- this means that in truth, either side's modifiers would trigger the callback. Under normal circumstances this won't be noticed because as soon as you switch to the alternate side's modifier, the flag change event will be detected and the hotkey will be disabled. However, as noted above, if Hammerspoon is particularly busy, it is possible for this event to be missed.\n   * a timer runs (once this Spoon has been started the first time) which will check to see if the eventtap has been internally disabled and re-enable it if necessary; alternatively you can re-issue [LeftRightHotkey:start()](#start) to force the eventtap to be reset if necessary.\n   * if your hotkeys seem out of sync, try pressing and releasing any modifier key -- this will reset the enabled/disabled hotkeys if a previous flag change was missed, but the eventtap is still running or has been reset by one of the methods described above.\n\nLike all Spoons, don't forget to use the [LeftRightHotkey:start()](#start) method to activate the modifier key watcher.\n\nDownload: [https://github.com/Hammerspoon/Spoons/raw/master/Spoons/LeftRightHotkey.spoon.zip](https://github.com/Hammerspoon/Spoons/raw/master/Spoons/LeftRightHotkey.spoon.zip)",
