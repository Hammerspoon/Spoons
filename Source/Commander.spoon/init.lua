--- === Commander ===
---
--- This spoon lets you execute commands from other spoon by a chooser.
---
--- The way of Commander to generate it command list is
--- it goes to each spoon and extract all public functions inside the spoon table.
--- for each function the name is set to "spoonName.functionName".
--- if the spoon has a table called `commandderCommandTable`, Commander will
--- ignore everything else and take whatever is in the table.
--- In this case the naming convention is the same.
--- Then Commander grabs all the functions in global table.
--- functions are tested against `Commander.ignoredCommandList`,
--- except when spoon author provides a `commanderCommandList`.
---
--- Commander.chooser is the chooser, you can set background color, rows, etc, to it.
