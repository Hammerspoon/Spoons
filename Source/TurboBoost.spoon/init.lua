---
--- A spoon to load/unload the Turbo Boost Disable kernel extension
--- from https://github.com/rugarciap/Turbo-Boost-Switcher.
---
--- Note: this spoon by default uses sudo to load/unload the kernel
--- extension, so for it to work from Hammerspoon, you need to
--- configure sudo to be able to load/unload the extension without a
--- password, or configure the load_kext_cmd and unload_kext_cmd
--- variables to use some other mechanism that prompts you for the
--- credentials.
---
--- For example, the following configuration (stored in
--- /etc/sudoers.d/turboboost) can be used to allow loading and
--- unloading the module without a password:
--- ```
--- Cmnd_Alias    TURBO_OPS = /sbin/kextunload /Applications/Turbo Boost Switcher.app/Contents/Resources/DisableTurboBoost.64bits.kext, /usr/bin/kextutil /Applications/Turbo Boost Switcher.app/Contents/Resources/DisableTurboBoost.64bits.kext
---
--- %admin ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: TURBO_OPS
--- ```
---
--- If you use this, please support the author of Turbo Boost Disabler
--- by purchasing the Pro version of the app!

--- TurboBoost:setState(state)
--- Method
--- Sets whether Turbo Boost should be disabled (kernel extension
--- loaded) or enabled (normal state, kernel extension not loaded).
---
--- Parameters:
---  * state - A boolean, false if Turbo Boost should be disabled
---    (load kernel extension), true if it should be enabled (unload
---    kernel extension if loaded).
---  * notify - Optional boolean indicating whether a notification
---    should be produced. If not given, the value of
---    TurboBoost.notify is used.
---
--- Returns:
---  * Boolean indicating new state
