--- Seal.plugin_search_paths
--- Variable
--- List of directories where Seal will look for plugins. Defaults to `~/.hammerspoon/seal_plugins/` and the Seal Spoon directory.
obj.plugin_search_paths = { hs.configdir .. "/seal_plugins", obj.spoonPath }

--- Seal:refreshCommandsForPlugin(plugin_name)
--- Method
--- Refresh the list of commands provided by the given plugin.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * plugin_name - the name of the plugin. Should be the name as passed to `loadPlugins()` or `loadPluginFromFile`.
---
--- Returns:
---  * The Seal object
---
--- Notes:
---  * Most Seal plugins expose a static list of commands (if any), which are registered at the time the plugin is loaded. This method is used for plugins which expose a dynamic or changing (e.g. depending on configuration) list of commands.
function obj:refreshCommandsForPlugin(plugin_name)
   plugin = self.plugins[plugin_name]
   if plugin.commands then
      for cmd,cmdInfo in pairs(plugin:commands()) do

            self.commands[cmd] = cmdInfo
         end
      end
   end
   return self
end

--- Seal:refreshAllCommands()
--- Method
--- Refresh the list of commands provided by all the currently loaded plugins.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * None
---
--- Returns:
---  * The Seal object
---
--- Notes:
---  * Most Seal plugins expose a static list of commands (if any), which are registered at the time the plugin is loaded. This method is used for plugins which expose a dynamic or changing (e.g. depending on configuration) list of commands.
function obj:refreshAllCommands()
   for p, _ in pairs(self.plugins) do

end

--- Seal:loadPluginFromFile(plugin_name, file)
--- Method
--- Loads a plugin from a given file
---
--- Parameters:
---  * plugin_name - the name of the plugin, without "seal_" at the beginning or ".lua" at the end
---  * file - the file where the plugin code is stored.
---
--- Returns:
---  * The Seal object if the plugin was successfully loaded, `nil` otherwise
---
--- Notes:
---  * You should normally use `Seal:loadPlugins()`. This method allows you to load plugins
---    from non-standard locations and is mostly a development interface.
---  * Some plugins may immediately begin doing background work (e.g. Spotlight searches)
function obj:loadPluginFromFile(plugin_name, file)
   local f,err = loadfile(file)
   if f~= nil then
      local plugin = f()
      plugin.seal = self
      self.plugins[plugin_name] = plugin

---  * Some plugins may immediately begin doing background work (e.g. Spotlight searches)
function obj:loadPlugins(plugins)
    self.chooser = hs.chooser.new(self.completionCallback)

--- Various APIs for Seal plugins

--- Seal.plugins
--- Constant
--- This is a table containing all of the loaded plugins for Seal. You should interact with it only via documented API that the plugins expose.
