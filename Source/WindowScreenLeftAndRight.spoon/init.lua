--- WindowScreenLeftAndRight.logger
--- Variable
--- Logger object used within the Spoon. Can be accessed to set the default log level for the messages coming from the Spoon.

--- WindowScreenLeftAndRight.defaultHotkeys
--- Variable
--- Table containing a sample set of hotkeys that can be
--- assigned to the different operations. These are not bound
--- by default - if you want to use them you have to call:
--- `spoon.WindowScreenLeftAndRight:bindHotkeys(spoon.WindowScreenLeftAndRight.defaultHotkeys)`
--- after loading the spoon. Value:
--- ```
---  {
---     screen_left = { {"ctrl", "alt", "cmd"}, "Left" },
---     screen_right= { {"ctrl", "alt", "cmd"}, "Right" },
---  }

--- WindowScreenLeftAndRight:bindHotkeys(mapping)
--- Method
