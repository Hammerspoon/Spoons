--- Variable

-- Internal terminology:
-- `actions` are the things hotkeys are bound to and express a user desire (eg. `third_left`: move a third further left
--   than the current `window_state`). See the keys of obj._window_moves or the keys of action_to_method_map in 
--   :bindHotkeys() for the available actions
-- `window_states` are states a window may be currently in (eg. `left_third`: the leftmost horizontal third of the screen)
-- sometimes `actions` and `window_states` share a name (eg. `left_half`)
-- sometimes `actions` and `window_states` don't share a name (`third_left`: `left_third`, `middle_third_h`, `right_third`)
--
-- `window_state_names` are states windows can be in (so since `third_left` implies a relative move there is no `third_left`
--   `window_state_name`, only a `third_left` `action`)
